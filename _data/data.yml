    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a research fellow in the School of Life and Environmental Sciences within the University of Sydney. I received a BS degree with cum laude in Environmental Engineering from University of California Riverside in USA, and PhD degree in Soil Science from University of Sydney. My doctoral research focused on the integration of novel data analytics and proximal sensing to analyse soil conditions. I explored the use of machine learning methods, including deep learning to improve the prediction accuracies of soil properties in large spectral databases.
